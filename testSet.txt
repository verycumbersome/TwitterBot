The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant. 	 0 
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked. 	 1 
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless. 	 0 
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount. 	 1 
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 	 1 
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy. 	 0 
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected. 	 1 
- Really, really good rice, all the time. 	 1 
The service was meh. 	 0 
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk. 	 0 
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense. 	 0 
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service ! 	 0 
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well. 	 1 
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good. 	 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating. 	 0 
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old. 	 0 
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying. 	 0 
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!! 	 1 
Everything was fresh and delicious! 	 1

This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed. 	 1 
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter. 	 1 
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back. 	 0 
The service here leaves a lot to be desired. 	 0 
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while. 	 1 
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order. 	 0 
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor. 	 0 
It was probably dirt. 	 0 
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor. 	 1 
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good. 	 1

The service was a bit lacking. 	 0 
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables. 	 0
